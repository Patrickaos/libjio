If you have to create big transactions, instead of creating a huge buffer you
can mmap a temporary file and periodically sync it; and when you're done, just
jtrans_commit() the whole thing.

This would be a quite efficient way, without any performance penalty and a
very simple approach; I originally thought of doing this on the journal, but
it had many drawbacks that made it much expensive, slower and complex.
