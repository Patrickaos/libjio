Note that jfsck does not warantee that all the transactions are fully
completed, it can only do so if you run it without any other process accessing
the journal.

If you want to see this, you can take a look at the struct jfsck_result. It
include a field named in_progress which tell the number of transactions that
were in progress at the moment of checking, and as such weren't checked.

Be aware that the counter is not atomic, as two checkers can be running at the
same time.
