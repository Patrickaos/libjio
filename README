libjio - A library for Journaled I/O
Alberto Bertogli (albertogli@telpin.com.ar)
-------------------------------------------

As the name says, this is a simple userspace library to do journaled,
transaction-oriented I/O.

It provides a very simple transaction API to commit and rollback transactions,
and on top of that a unix-alike set of functions to perform most regular
operations (ie. open, read, write).

On the disk, the file you work on is exactly like a regular one, but a
special directory is created to store in-flight transactions.

This allows both simple file manipulation, recovery and debugging because
everything is isolated.

There are more detailed documents: a programming guide, a brief introduction
to the design and inner workings, and the manpage; all in the doc/ directory.

The first two, called 'guide' and 'libjio' respectively, are both in txt and
lyx formats, with HTML, Postscript and PDF versions in the website, which are
not included in the package for space reasons.


To see how to install it, please read the INSTALL file.

It is licensed under the Open Software License version 2.0.

Thanks,
