libjio - A library for Journalled I/O
Alberto Bertogli (albertogli@telpin.com.ar)
-------------------------------------------

As the name says, this is a simple library to do journalled,
transaction-oriented I/O.

It provides a very simple transaction api to commit and rollback transactions,
and on top of that a unix-alike set of functions to perform most regular
operations (ie. open, read, write).

On the disk, the file you work on is exactly like a regular one, but a
special directory is created to store in-flight transactions.

This allows both simple file manipulation, recovery and debugging because
everything is isolated.

There's a more detailed document about the library itself in doc/libjio.ps
(or, alternatively, the ascii version doc/libjio.txt), and a manpage where you
will find the programming reference.


It is licensed under the Open Software License version 2.0.

Thanks,
