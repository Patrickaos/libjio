libjio - A library for Journaled I/O
Alberto Bertogli (albertogli@telpin.com.ar)
-------------------------------------------

As the name says, this is a simple userspace library to do journaled,
transaction-oriented I/O.

It provides a very simple transaction API to commit and rollback transactions,
and on top of that a unix-alike set of functions to perform most regular
operations (ie. open, read, write).

On the disk, the file you work on is exactly like a regular one, but a
special directory is created to store in-flight transactions.

This allows both simple file manipulation, recovery and debugging because
everything is isolated.

There's a more detailed document about the library itself in doc/libjio.lyx
(to the 'LyX' editor; there are HTML, Postscript, PDF and TXT versions in the
website, which are not included here for space reasons), and a manpage where
you will find the programming reference.


To see how to install it, please read the INSTALL file.

It is licensed under the Open Software License version 2.0.

Thanks,
