Here are the notes for upgrading libjio from one version to another.

While normally nothing should be done, sometimes things change and some
actions need to be done. Here's the listing for the releases, you should
always check it before upgrading.

You should always clean all your files before upgrading. While I don't expect
the transaction on-disk format to change, it's a good practise and it doesn't
take much. If it's mandatory, it will be noted.

If you want to see what motivated the changes, see the changelog or just ask.


0.18 -> 0.19
* Applications need to be recompiled due to a change in the flag numbering.
* A flag number has changed, from J_COMMITED to J_COMMITTED. If you used that
	flag, you need to rename it.
