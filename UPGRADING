Here are the notes for upgrading libjio from one version to another.

While normally nothing should be done, sometimes things change and some
actions need to be done. Here's the listing for the releases, you should
always check it before upgrading.

You should always clean all your files before upgrading. While I don't expect
the transaction on-disk format to change, it's a good practise and it doesn't
take much. If it's mandatory, it will be noted.

If you want to see what motivated the changes, see the changelog or just ask.

0.22 -> 0.23
* The return values of jfsck() have changed, so applications using it need to
	be recompiled. The Python version now raises IOError on failures, and
	no longer returns None.

0.21 -> 0.22
* Applications need to be recompiled due to a change in the jfs structure.

0.19 -> 0.20
* Applications need to be recompiled due to a change in the jfs structure.
* When you link your applications with libjio, you need to make sure you
	compile using large file support.

0.18 -> 0.19
* Applications need to be recompiled due to a change in the flag numbering.
* A flag number has changed, from J_COMMITED to J_COMMITTED. If you used that
	flag, you need to rename it.
