To install the library and the checker (called jiofsck), run as root

# make install


It will copy the library to /usr/local/lib, manpages to /usr/local/man,
binaries to /usr/local/bin, and headers to /usr/local/include.

If you want to change the prefix directory (/usr/local by default), for
instance, to /home/myself/usr; just run:

# make PREFIX=/home/myself/usr install


This will create inside PREFIX the directories "bin", "lib", "include" and
"man" if necesary, and put the required files in there.


After installing, you need to run "ldconfig" in order to update your dynamic
library cache.

So, if you want to install to /usr (like most distro bundled software do),
this is a brief command line summary:

make PREFIX=/usr install
ldconfig


There are other small options that might be useful (like compiling with
debugging information), you can check the Make.conf file for more information.


After installing, you're ready to use the library; you can see how by looking
at the manpage with "man libjio".


If you have any question, suggestion or comment, please send it to the mailing
list, at libjio-devel@auriga.wearlab.de.
